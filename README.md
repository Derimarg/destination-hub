## Description

     The porpose of Destination Hub is to make it easier for users to find and save a bucket list of travel destinations.  When searching a location, users will be able to find different attractions and create their own “bucket list” of events.

     It is often hard to remember and research all the different attractions. We are building this website that looks to make the process more efficient.
