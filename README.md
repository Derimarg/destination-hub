Acceptance Criteria
    Given that I am looking for a bucket list trip, I should be presented with an option to enter a travel destination that is on my bucket list.  It should ask me to enter a city, state/province and country. It should ask me the radius in miles or km that I want to travel from that location to visit attractions.  When I enter the information, it should validate I have filled in all the fields and then it should return 5 local attractions based on my input and restaurants that are nearby.
